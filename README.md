cleaver-editor
==============

Single page editor for [cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver) slides in your browser. Open index.html, edit your slides, save presentation to disk.

See it in action [over here](http://www.jscacourse.co.vu:4321/index.html) if I don't forget to maintain sandbox server.

This thing was made possible thanks to [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).

How to contribute
=================
Don't hesitate to open issue, or just do regular fork-feature branch-pull request thing on me.

Hint for development: to have build update on *.js file changes, be sure to run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run-script dev`
